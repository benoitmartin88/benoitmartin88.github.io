    content: |-
      I am currently a Research Scientist at Maison de la Simulation, a research laboratory involving CEA, CNRS, 
      Université Paris-Saclay, and Université Versailles Saint-Quentin. 
      I obtained my PhD in Distributed Systems at Sorbonne Université in Paris under the supervision of [Marc Shapiro](https://perso.lip6.fr/Marc.Shapiro). 
      I earned my BSc and Engineering degree in Software Architecture from École Supérieure de Génie Informatique (ESGI) 
      in 2012 and 2015 respectively, and my MSc from Université du Québec à Chicoutimi (UQAC) in 2015.
      Prior to my PhD, I worked as an engineer in high-performance computing (HPC), in the fintech industry and as a 
      research engineer at Inria with the Aramis team.

      My current research interests include in-situ data analytics for HPC, with a focus on issues related to 
      distributed systems and programming models.

      To this end, I’m interested in:
      - Transactional Memory Models
      - Consistency Models for Shared Memory
      - Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)
      - Actor Model

      I also enjoy the occasional game of chess, a good book and a warm cup of coffee.

              and [Mesaac Makpangou](https://lip6.fr/Mesaac.Makpangou).
              My work was on stateful serverless functions that are chained together through a message-based infrastructure 
              and that store their durable state in a separate database.
              This separation between storage and compute creates serious challenges that may lead to inconsistency and application crashes.
              A unified consistency model for message passing and shared memory is required to avoid such errors.
              The model should ensure that multiple pieces of data remain mutually consistent, whether data is sent using messages or 
              shared in a distributed memory.
              Based on a well-known message-based model (actors) and a state model (transactional shared memory), 
              my work proposes a unified communication and persistence model called Transactional Turn Causal consistency (TTCC).
              TTCC is asynchronous, preserves isolation, and ensures that the message and memory view are mutually causally consistent.

          Abstract:

          Today, stateful serverless functions are chained together through a message-based infrastructure and store their durable 
          state in a separate database. This separation between storage and compute creates serious challenges that may lead to 
          inconsistency and application crashes. A unified consistency model for message passing and shared memory is required to 
          avoid such errors. The model should ensure that multiple pieces of data remain mutually consistent, whether data is sent 
          using messages or shared in a distributed memory.
          Based on a well-known message-based model (actors) and a state model (transactional shared memory), we propose a unified 
          communication and persistence model called Transactional Turn Causal consistency (TTCC). TTCC is asynchronous, preserves 
          isolation, and ensures that the message and memory view are mutually causally consistent.
