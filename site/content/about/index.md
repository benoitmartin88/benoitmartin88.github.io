I'm a PhD student in distributed systems at Sorbonne University in Paris.  Prior to being a student I worked as an engineer in high-perforance computing, in the fintech industry and as a research engineer at Inria (public research institute).

I'm currently interested in bringing shared memory to the actor model (I know, I know...). This includes topics related to transactions, causal consistency and CRDTs.

Besides from being a student, I'm also a dad ! (I know, I know...)  
I try my best to share my passions and hobbies with my daughter. This includes traveling, reading, playing music and chess among other things.
