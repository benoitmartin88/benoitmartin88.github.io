I recently finished my PhD in distributed systems at Sorbonne University in Paris.  Prior to being a student I worked as an engineer in high-performance computing, in the fintech industry and as a research engineer at Inria (public research institute).

I'm currently interested in bringing shared memory to the actor model to better build the next generation of serverless computing frameworks. To this end, my interests includes topics related to transactions, consistency models, CRDTs, etc...

I also enjoy the occasional game of chess, a good book and a nice cup of coffee.
