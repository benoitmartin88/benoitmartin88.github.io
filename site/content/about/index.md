## Biography

I am currently a Research Scientist at [Maison de la Simulation](https://mdls.fr), a research laboratory involving CEA, CNRS, Université Paris-Saclay, and Université Versailles Saint-Quentin.
I obtained my PhD in distributed systems at Sorbonne Université in Paris under the supervision of [Marc Shapiro](https://perso.lip6.fr/Marc.Shapiro).
I earned my BSc and Engineering degree from École Supérieure de Génie Informatique (ESGI) in 2012 and 2015 respectively, and my MSc from Université du Québec à Chicoutimi (UQAC) in 2015.
Prior to my PhD, I worked as an engineer in high-performance computing, in the fintech industry and as a research engineer at Inria with the [Aramis team](https://www.aramislab.fr).

I also enjoy the occasional game of chess, a good book and a warm cup of coffee.

## Research interests

My current research interest include in-situ analytics in high-performance computing, with a focus on issues related to distributed systems and programming models.
To this end, I'm interested in:
- Transactional Memory Models
- Consistency Models for Shared Memory
- Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)
- Actor Model
