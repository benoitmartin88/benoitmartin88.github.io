I'm currently a permanent research scientist at [Maison de la Simulation](https://mdls.fr), a collaborative laboratory involving CEA, CNRS, Université Paris-Saclay, and Université Versailles Saint-Quentin.
My work primarily revolves around in-situ analytics in high-performance computing (HPC) and numerical simulations, with a particular emphasis on physical applications, parallel software engineering and programming models.
I'm currently also interested in implementing an efficient C++ actor model to better build the next generation of serverless computing frameworks and HPC in-situ workflows. 
To this end, my interests includes topics related to transactional memory, consistency models, CRDTs, etc...

I previously finished my PhD in distributed systems at Sorbonne Université in Paris under the supervision of [Marc Shapiro](https://perso.lip6.fr/Marc.Shapiro).
During [my PhD](../thesis) I essentially worked on the use of shared memory in the actor programming model. 
This resulted in a transactional, causally consistent, turned-based memory model (TTCC) that enables safe use of shared memory between actors.

Prior to my PhD, I worked as an engineer in high-performance computing, in the fintech industry and as a research engineer at Inria with the [Aramis team](https://www.aramislab.fr).

I also enjoy the occasional game of chess, a good book and a nice cup of coffee.
