This separation between storage and compute creates serious challenges that may lead to inconsistency and application crashes. A unified consistency model for message passing and shared memory is required to avoid such errors. The model should ensure that multiple pieces of data remain mutually consistent, whether data is sent using messages or shared in a distributed memory.\nBased on a well-known message-based model (actors) and a state model (transactional shared memory), we propose a unified communication and persistence model called Transactional Turn Causal consistency (TTCC). TTCC is asynchronous, preserves isolation, and ensures that the message and memory view are mutually causally consistent.\n","date":"21 April 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/thesis/","section":"","summary":"I defended my PhD thesis, \u0026ldquo;TTCC: Transactional-Turn Causal Consistency\u0026rdquo;, in Paris on Friday 21st April 2023 at 14:00 (Paris Time).

LIP6 09/2019 - 05/2023 PhD Student Today, stateful serverless functions are chained together through a message-based infrastructure and store their durable state in a separate database. This separation between storage and compute creates serious challenges that may lead to inconsistency and application crashes. A unified consistency model for message passing and shared memory is required to avoid such errors.

During my time teaching this class, I also prepared and supervised exams and group projects. In-class lessons and projects were in C++. Inria Aramis team 05/2018 - 10/2019 R\u0026amp;D Engineer Based at the Brain and Spine Institute at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital in Paris, I was a member of the ARAMIS Inria team. I participated the development of Deformetrica which was ported from C++ to Python. I contributed by optimizing the performance of the application to help PhD students run experiments on a bigger dataset. Also, I contributed to PyKeops which is used in Deformetrica to offload kernel operations. I used the following technologies: PyTorch: tensor library with auto-differentiation used within the Deformetrica application Anaconda: library repository for Deformetrica Python/Jupyter/Matplotlib/Nibabel: to prototype plot and read MR Images C++/Cuda: Keops (kernel operations library) Tredzone 07/2015 - 03/2018 R\u0026amp;D Software Engineer Tredzone offers a high performance, low latency framework in C++ and Java for the capital market industry and other performance-hungry industries. I contributed to the development of the C++ and Java actor model runtime. Additionally, we develop a library in C++11, which leverages our C++ actor framework to compose a high performance application. Our framework is used in production at Euronext to power the core of their Optiq solution. The following technologies are used: C++11 : highly abstracted runtime and SDK Solarflare : sub-microsecond feedhandlers Java JNI : predictable latency Java runtime and SDK Realtime Linux : tweaking for stable and ultra-low latency Intel Corp 07/2014 - 12/2014 HPC Application Engineer Intern at the Exascale research lab in Paris. The lab was founded by Intel, the University of Versailles Saint Quentin (UVSQ), le Commissariat à l’énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives (CEA) and Grand Equipement National de Calcul Intensif (GENCI). I was involved in the analysis and code optimization of the Gysela5D gyrokinetic code for Intel’s Many Integrated Core Architecture (Intel MIC/Xeon Phi) and Sandy Bridge Xeon Architecture.

Yay !!\nI finally took the time to set this website up. I plan on using this space to document my projects as well as ramble about a few random things.\nBefore writing anything else, I\u0026rsquo;ll start by explaining how this site is built. First of all, I have no need for any dynamic content. Everything on this site is static, so I opted for a static website generator. Furthermore, I love using Obsidian to manage and write in markdown. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably write a post about obsidian in a near future. Anyhow, this website is generated from markdown using Hugo and the Blowfish theme ❤️.\nHugo # Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. Its lightweight, super fast and easy to use. An alternative to Hugo is Jekyll which is natively supported on Github pages, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like having any kind of Ruby on my laptop.\nTo start things off, I mostly followed the quick start guide from the official Hugo website: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start. From my project directory, I first initialized an empty Hugo site using the hugo new site site command. This creates a site directory in which the default Hugo file structure is created. This is what file structure looks like using the tree -L 2 command from my project root folder. (I guess I\u0026rsquo;ll also write a post about the different tools that I like to use.)\n. └── site ├── archetypes ├── assets ├── content ├── data ├── layouts ├── resources ├── static └── themes Blowfish # The next step is installing a theme. For this, I headed to https://themes.gohugo.io and I selected Blowfish. I chose to install this theme using the git submodule method which I find simple to setup and easy to update. The following commands got me setup with a git repo and the git submodule.\ngit init git submodule add -b main https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish.git site/themes/blowfish I then headed to the theme\u0026rsquo;s documentation to set things up as I wanted. Blowfish is very configurable and I didn\u0026rsquo;t know exactly what I wanted to change, so I decided to take inspiration from the lowkey setup. I very much like its simplicity.\nGithub pages # All that is left is to host this site. I chose Github pages as its free and my code is versioned there anyways. I first started by creating a public repo that has the same name as my Github user. I then wanted to use Github actions to generate my static site when ever I pushed a new version on the master branch. Hugo setup is what I used. I basically sets up a workflow which builds Hugo and deploys the generated static site to the gh-pages branch. Nice! All that was left to do was setting up my domain name and the repo\u0026rsquo;s page settings.\nFinal thoughts # Overall, the process took a couple of hours. Which in my books, is a short amount of time for any IT related endeavour. I\u0026rsquo;m stoked !\n","date":"21 January 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/20230120-first-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"This is my first post using Hugo and the Blowfish theme.","title":"My first post !","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"21 January 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/post/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"post","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"21 January 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"I always try to find time to work and learn something new.
