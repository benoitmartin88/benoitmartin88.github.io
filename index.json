This separation between storage and compute creates serious challenges that may lead to inconsistency and application crashes.

During my time teaching this class, I also prepared and supervised exams and group projects. In-class lessons and projects were in C++. Inria Aramis team 05/2018 - 10/2019 R\u0026amp;D Engineer Based at the Brain and Spine Institute at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital in Paris, I was a member of the ARAMIS Inria team. I participated the development of Deformetrica which was ported from C++ to Python. I contributed by optimizing the performance of the application to help PhD students run experiments on a bigger dataset. Also, I contributed to PyKeops which is used in Deformetrica to offload kernel operations. I used the following technologies: PyTorch: tensor library with auto-differentiation used within the Deformetrica application Anaconda: library repository for Deformetrica Python/Jupyter/Matplotlib/Nibabel: to prototype plot and read MR Images C++/Cuda: Keops (kernel operations library) Tredzone 07/2015 - 03/2018 R\u0026amp;D Software Engineer Tredzone offers a high performance, low latency framework in C++ and Java for the capital market industry and other performance-hungry industries. I contributed to the development of the C++ and Java actor model runtime. Additionally, we develop a library in C++11, which leverages our C++ actor framework to compose a high performance application. Our framework is used in production at Euronext to power the core of their Optiq solution. The following technologies are used: C++11 : highly abstracted runtime and SDK Solarflare : sub-microsecond feedhandlers Java JNI : predictable latency Java runtime and SDK Realtime Linux : tweaking for stable and ultra-low latency Intel Corp 07/2014 - 12/2014 HPC Application Engineer Intern at the Exascale research lab in Paris. The lab was founded by Intel, the University of Versailles Saint Quentin (UVSQ), le Commissariat à l’énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives (CEA) and Grand Equipement National de Calcul Intensif (GENCI). I was involved in the analysis and code optimization of the Gysela5D gyrokinetic code for Intel’s Many Integrated Core Architecture (Intel MIC/Xeon Phi) and Sandy Bridge Xeon Architecture.

Yay !!\nI finally took the time to set this website up. I plan on using this space to document my projects as well as ramble about a few random things.\nBefore writing anything else, I\u0026rsquo;ll start by explaining how this site is built. First of all, I have no need for any dynamic content. Everything on this site is static, so I opted for a static website generator. Furthermore, I love using Obsidian to manage and write in markdown. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably write a post about obsidian in a near future. Anyhow, this website is generated from markdown using Hugo and the Blowfish theme ❤️.\nHugo # Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. Its lightweight, super fast and easy to use. An alternative to Hugo is Jekyll which is natively supported on Github pages, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like having any kind of Ruby on my laptop.\nTo start things off, I mostly followed the quick start guide from the official Hugo website: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start. From my project directory, I first initialized an empty Hugo site using the hugo new site site command. This creates a site directory in which the default Hugo file structure is created. This is what file structure looks like using the tree -L 2 command from my project root folder. (I guess I\u0026rsquo;ll also write a post about the different tools that I like to use.)\n. └── site ├── archetypes ├── assets ├── content ├── data ├── layouts ├── resources ├── static └── themes Blowfish # The next step is installing a theme. For this, I headed to https://themes.gohugo.io and I selected Blowfish. I chose to install this theme using the git submodule method which I find simple to setup and easy to update. The following commands got me setup with a git repo and the git submodule.\ngit init git submodule add -b main https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish.git site/themes/blowfish I then headed to the theme\u0026rsquo;s documentation to set things up as I wanted. Blowfish is very configurable and I didn\u0026rsquo;t know exactly what I wanted to change, so I decided to take inspiration from the lowkey setup. I very much like its simplicity.\nGithub pages # All that is left is to host this site. I chose Github pages as its free and my code is versioned there anyways. I first started by creating a public repo that has the same name as my Github user. I then wanted to use Github actions to generate my static site when ever I pushed a new version on the master branch. Hugo setup is what I used. I basically sets up a workflow which builds Hugo and deploys the generated static site to the gh-pages branch. Nice! All that was left to do was setting up my domain name and the repo\u0026rsquo;s page settings.\nFinal thoughts # Overall, the process took a couple of hours. Which in my books, is a short amount of time for any IT related endeavour. I\u0026rsquo;m stoked !\n","date":"21 January 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/20230120-first-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"This is my first post using Hugo and the Blowfish theme.","title":"My first post !","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"21 January 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/post/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Post","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"21 January 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"I always try to find time to work and learn something new.
