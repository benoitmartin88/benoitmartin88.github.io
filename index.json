Yay !!\nI finally took the time to set this website up. I plan on using this space to document my projects as well as ramble about a few random things.\nBefore writing anything else, I\u0026rsquo;ll start by explaining how this site is built. First of all, I have no need for any dynamic content. Everything on this site is static, so I opted for a static website generator. Furthermore, I love using Obsidian to manage and write in markdown. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably write a post about obsidian in a near future. Anyhow, this website is generated from markdown using Hugo and the Blowfish theme ❤️.\nHugo\u003e Hugo # Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. Its lightweight, super fast and easy to use. An alternative to Hugo is Jekyll which is natively supported on Github pages, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like having any kind of Ruby on my laptop.\nTo start things off, I mostly followed the quick start guide from the official Hugo website: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start. From my project directory, I first initialized an empty Hugo site using the hugo new site site command. This creates a site directory in which the default Hugo file structure is created. This is what file structure looks like using the tree -L 2 command from my project root folder. (I guess I\u0026rsquo;ll also write a post about the different tools that I like to use.)\n. └── site ├── archetypes ├── assets ├── content ├── data ├── layouts ├── resources ├── static └── themes Blowfish\u003e Blowfish # The next step is installing a theme. For this, I headed to https://themes.gohugo.io and I selected Blowfish. I chose to install this theme using the git submodule method which I find simple to setup and easy to update. The following commands got me setup with a git repo and the git submodule.\ngit init git submodule add -b main https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish.git site/themes/blowfish I then headed to the theme\u0026rsquo;s documentation to set things up as I wanted. Blowfish is very configurable and I didn\u0026rsquo;t know exactly what I wanted to change, so I decided to take inspiration from the lowkey setup. I very much like its simplicity.\nGithub pages\u003e Github pages # All that is left is to host this site. I chose Github pages as its free and my code is versioned there anyways. I first started by creating a public repo that has the same name as my Github user. I then wanted to use Github actions to generate my static site when ever I pushed a new version on the master branch. Hugo setup is what I used. I basically sets up a workflow which builds Hugo and deploys the generated static site to the gh-pages branch. Nice! All that was left to do was setting up my domain name and the repo\u0026rsquo;s page settings.\nFinal thoughts\u003e Final thoughts # Overall, the process took a couple of hours. Which in my books, is a short amount of time for any IT related endeavour. I\u0026rsquo;m stoked !\n","date":"21 January 2023","permalink":"/posts/20230120-first-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"This is my first post using Hugo and the Blowfish theme.","title":"My first post !"},{"content":"","date":"21 January 2023","permalink":"/categories/post/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"post"},{"content":"","date":"21 January 2023","permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"I always try to find time to work and learn something new.
